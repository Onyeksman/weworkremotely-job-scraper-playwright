Nutrient delivers the building blocks to accelerate digital transformation for modern businesses. Nutrient's SDKs, cloud-based document processing, low-code solutions for M365, and workflow automation platform transform document ecosystems. The company powers thousands of organizations worldwide, including more than 15 percent of Global 500 brands, thousands of commercial businesses across 80 nations, and more than 130 public sector organizations in 24 countries. Backed by Insight Partners and based in Raleigh, N.C., Nutrient operates offices in the US, England, France, and Austria, with employees distributed throughout the world. Nutrient is on a mission to evolve the human experience with documents, and its products are the integration of industry-leading document and workflow automation technology from PSPDFKit, ORPALIS, Aquaforest, Muhimbi, and Integrify. To learn more, visit www.nutrient.io.","Who We Are…

At Nutrient, we equip developers and innovators with cutting-edge tools to simplify workflows and accelerate impactful software creation. We’re on a mission to redefine how documents are created, shared, and experienced. Our software development kits enable companies to work smarter and faster, saving time and expenses along the way, while effectively replacing the need for paper processes.

Your Role at Nutrient…

The team you will be joining is responsible for the Nutrient Web SDK. Take a look at its API docs to get an understanding of the scope involved: It is a toolbox for web engineers and application developers who need a painless way to render, edit and process documents. It either runs client-side using WebAssembly or connects to the Nutrient Document Engine.

This means that our SDK has to work for diverse use cases we constantly keep learning about from our customers. It needs to be convenient to use and easy to integrate; well architected, tested and documented; and loved by LLMs.

Your day to day work ranges (depending on your personal preferences and the current priorities) from writing code and documentation to talking directly with customers in order to understand their use cases and devise solutions for them, which you will incorporate into the evolving architecture of the product.

If you think you have the aptitude to contribute to building this product we would like to hear from you. You'll have autonomy, learn a lot and will shape the future of this product.

What You’ll Bring…

Strong General Programming Skills: You're well versed in OOP & FP, data structures & algorithms and understand that even a client-side SDK forms part of a larger distributed system. You’re driven by a curiosity to understand how things work.
Passion for Building in the B2D Space:  You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by getting the user/developer experience right
Collaborative and Self-Managing: You don't need hand-holding, and you're gaining energy from exchanging ideas, both async and sync.
Bias towards Shipping: You move fast and take ownership for solving problems from start to finish.

What We'll Bring…

We are a globally distributed company, backed by Insight Partners. We embrace a low-meeting culture and prioritize asynchronous communication to provide flexibility and focus. Working hours overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe, and Asia.

We offer competitive salaries, comprehensive benefits, and an annual global retreat to celebrate achievements and foster connections. Past retreats have taken place in locations like Croatia, Spain, and Greece. 

Nutrient believes in equal opportunity, we employ people from many different cultures and countries. We celebrate diversity and are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, skill sets, perspectives, as well as providing our employees with a work environment free of harassment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, marital status, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other non-merit factor. 

We are a remote company. To ensure overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe and Asia, we’re looking for someone who will have a significant overlap with US and European working hours.  If working from the US, you must be located in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, or Virginia for payroll processing.",https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/nutrient-senior-typescript-sdk-engineer,See Job Description,https://weworkremotely.com/company/nutrient,https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0167/0040/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&w=50&h=50&dpr=2&fit=fill&auto=compress,4

The Million View Club (MVC) is the premier education and community platform for YouTube creators and their teams, co-founded with Mario Joos (ex-MrBeast Retention Director). We deliver elite curriculum, live workshops, and tools that help creators consistently grow their channels and build scalable media businesses.

The Role

We’re seeking an experienced Full Stack Developer to take ownership of the MVC web platform. As we expand access to a broader creator audience, this role is critical in preserving our design-driven brand identity while enabling scalable growth.

You’ll work with a world-class team that has built and scaled VC-backed education products, running continuous experiments around onboarding, pricing, and growth. This role requires equal parts design sensibility, analytical rigor, and execution speed — building beautiful interfaces while testing and iterating quickly to remove friction and drive conversions.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript/JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React Context API, TanStack Query, Mux Player

Backend & Infra: Supabase (Postgres with RLS), Stripe (subscriptions, trials, webhooks), Storyblok CMS, Zapier, Vercel

Design: Custom components, complex hover states, animations, Schibsted Grotesk & Neue Haas Grotesk



What You’ll Work On

Immediate priorities:

Refine UI/UX for a smoother onboarding experience

Optimize performance (Core Web Vitals, video playback, responsiveness)

Run growth experiments (trial conversions, onboarding flows, pricing tests)

Enhance mobile experience and accessibility



Ongoing responsibilities:

Ship pixel-perfect UI with sophisticated interactions

Maintain subscription flows and database policies

Continuously test and iterate on onboarding and pricing models

Collaborate with product, design, and growth to identify and eliminate friction



Who You Are

Experienced in growth engineering, CRO, or A/B testing frameworks

Proficient with TypeScript, Tailwind, Stripe, PostgreSQL

Obsessed with speed, performance, and reducing user friction

Bonus if you have: Supabase, Storyblok, Mux, or educational platform experience

Why This Role is Unique

This isn’t a typical CRUD app or agency build. MVC is a platform where design craft meets growth engineering:

You’ll run rapid experiments with real impact on thousands of creators

You’ll help simplify complex education content for mainstream audiences

Every feature you ship will directly reduce drop-offs and improve conversions



Application
Please include:

Portfolio of design-heavy web apps you’ve built

Examples of complex UI/animations

Experience with subscription-based platforms

Most of our customers are healthcare business owners and we love helping them get the most out of Cliniko. We don't care too much about your experience or credentials; we’re far more interested in your personality, passion, and work ethic. A sense of humour helps a lot too! 

 

What is Cliniko?

Cliniko is practice management software that makes life easy for allied health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes, running video consultations, and much more. The software is used globally by more than 100,000 people every day.

 

Our team

Behind Cliniko is a team of 60 people, spread around the world. We work completely remotely, although our base is in Melbourne, Australia. We care more about finding the best person for the job than looking for someone that lives nearby.

We don't have managers, we almost never have meetings, and there are no time sheets to complete. We're responsible, autonomous, creative, and proactive in doing our best for our customers. We're focused on making great software and we take pride in doing good work. It’s also important to us that we have a positive impact on the world.

If you want to know more about how we work, our founder, Joel, gave a talk about it (9 years ago, but we still work this way!).

 

What you'll work on

You’ll spend your time supporting Cliniko customers. This includes:

Responding to chat/email messages from existing customers.
Helping people decide if Cliniko would suit their business.
Communicating with people via social media.
Working with our developers to resolve issues.
Working with third party integrators to solve customer problems.

Our goal is to do right by our customers in every single interaction, so you'll be empowered (and expected) to provide amazing support.

 

Requirements

We are looking for someone to help with coverage during NZ and Australian business hours (Mon-Fri, within 5am-7pm AEDT). There is also the option to work some hours over the weekend instead of during the week. 

We won't consider applications from anyone intending to work outside of these hours, and your work day must entirely fall within 6am to 7pm in your local time zone. We understand that some people consider themselves ""night owls”, but this won't be a reason to consider you for this role if you are in a conflicting time zone. Instead, please keep an eye out for when we’re hiring in a more suitable time for you. We care greatly about the health of our team and their ability to work with us long term. We want to make sure the job is a positive in their lives, and we believe working during daylight hours is important for that.

 

About you

You want to work in a place where you can do your best work and have fun too. You want to constantly improve. You have empathy and can place yourself in the shoes of the people using Cliniko. 

You have superb English skills (both verbal and written). You are able to communicate your thoughts in a friendly, accurate, and jargon-free way. You appreciate a good Oxford comma.

No matter what your background is, or how you identify, if you feel you would be a great fit here, we encourage you to apply. We are committed to the continual diversification of the team and working to constantly improve our inclusivity, which is crucial to how we work.

 

How we work

Here are some things that we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:

30-hour work week, full-time pay.
Flexible hours.
Work from anywhere.
Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).
Supplied computer equipment.
Ergonomic furniture.
Fresh organic fruit delivered weekly to your home.
Overseas trips for team meet-ups.
No managers.
No scheduled meetings.

The salary for this position will be $90,000 AUD, or equivalent in your local currency.

The pay is based on the work you'll do with us and the value you'll add to our team. Don't be discouraged if this is above your previous earnings. Your income history is not part of our decision making.

 

In summary

We're looking for someone special. We don't hire often and when we do, we usually get thousands of applicants. We will do our best to offer you a job you can love, and one that lets you achieve your best, but we also expect you to do your part.

You should be absolutely passionate about providing amazing support. You should take pride in your work and be excited to do it.

 

How to apply

After hitting the red ""Apply now"" button, you'll be taken to an application page with a few question on it. The “short friendly summary” field needs to give us enough information to be interested in taking you to the next stage. We typically get a lot of applications, so please put some effort into this section. Notably, there's no resume or cover letter submission, so this is your spot to give us some insight into who you are. Be yourself, there’s no need for formality! 

There will also be a few other short questions that require some searching on our website. It's important to answer all of them correctly, as we won’t consider any applications that get any of these wrong.

We recommend not using AI to help you with your application. ChatGPT’s personality just isn’t going to make the cut and get past the first round. As well as probably leading to your application being rejected, you will not be able to rely on AI in the support role that you're applying for. Although we continually test AI tools to see if they can be useful in our workflow, our support team currently doesn't use them because we have found they can lower the quality of our work.

Note: While the form does allow you to upload a resume, it’s only to pre-fill the contact fields for you. We won’t actually see the resume.

Applications are open until the 7th of November at 11:59 PM AEDT. 

 

What you can expect after applying

Once you’ve applied, sit back and relax while we get to work on our side! We’ll be reviewing all the applications as they come in and we’ll get back to you within 2 weeks after applications close. Everyone will hear back from us, successful or not.

If we select you, the next stage will be a short 5 minute chat with our founder, Joel. Following the chat, if you’re still a contender, there will be a support task to complete. These tasks are paid.

Lastly, you’ll meet with some people from our team and then we’ll make the final decision on who we hire. This is the exciting part for us and hopefully also for you. This will happen fast, and the start date will be chosen by the applicant.

We know it’s quite a process to go through, so we want to make sure you know what you’re in for up front. We’ll be transparent with everyone along the way.

One final note, unfortunately due to the quantity of applications we receive, we are not able to provide feedback for those not successful in the first round. In the later stages, we’ll do our best to provide what we can, if requested.

It's time to hire another amazing individual again. You could be the pick of the litter! Are you a resourceful problem solver who loves delivering top-notch customer service? Can you provide amazing and personalized phone support? If you’re good at diagnosing technical issues, enjoy helping customers, and can deliver a mind-blowing experience via phone, chat, and email support, then please apply!

Porkbun is a fully remote domain name registrar. We’re looking to add multiple U.S.-based, full-time Technical Support Representatives. We are hiring from within states where we are already operational; eligibility is restricted to: California, Idaho, Oregon, Texas, or Washington.

From .com to .pizza to .plumbing, Porkbun sells more than 500 domain extensions directly to consumers. Our no-nonsense interface and super-affordable prices mean we’re adding new customers at a fantastic rate. We have become the go-to registrar for tech-savvy individuals such as developers. At the same time, bargain-hunters are thrilled to learn that we offer incredible support despite our industry-low prices.

We think Porkbun.com is the best registrar in the world, and if you check out our TrustPilot reviews, you’ll see that’s not just our own bias talking. But even the easiest-to-use interface can’t solve every customer problem.

Typical issues:

“How do I connect my domain to Shopify?”

“How do I transfer my domain to Porkbun?”

“My website isn’t working.”

“How do I purchase WordPress hosting?”

“Why didn’t my payment go through?”

“How do I connect my hosted email to Outlook?”

“Why is your company named Porkbun?”

Experience –  professional or personal – with domains, hosting, DNS is required, or, absent that, very strong experience in live technical support.  We are looking for someone with proven technical and diagnostic ability who loves learning new things. Live support experience that spans multiple modes of support, such as email, chat, and phone, is valued. 

Important skills:

You can provide amazing live support via phone and chat, even in the face of customer stress, tantrums, and disasters of their own making (and sometimes ours )

You can write emails with a professional tone

You love the feeling of making a customer happy

You’re an excellent problem solver

You have at least two years of tech support experience, either at an internal help desk or customer-facing position

Experience with domains, hosting, and DNS

You have a steady Internet connection and a quiet room to work out of

You work efficiently in a remote work environment

You are perfectly fine with horrible hilarious puns

If the above describes you, please follow the instructions below EXACTLY and respond accurately -- failure to do so means we will filter out your application.

Attach your resume and cover letter to an email as two separate .pdf documents

Address your email with the subject line “Technical Support Representative”

Begin your email body by copying, pasting, and responding to the below qualifying questions. If you are responding NO, we are sorry, but you are not eligible for the role:

Are you based in the USA and eligible for employment (Yes/No)?

Are you based in one of the following states: California, Idaho, Oregon, Texas, or Washington (Yes/No)? 

Do you have two or more years of live technical support experience, or experience with domains, DNS, hosting? (Yes/No) If yes, which? 

Are you available and interested in working both Saturday and Sunday(Yes/No)?

Feel free to add other relevant, brief content to your email but it must begin with those questions and your accurate responses

Send that email with attachments to careers+support@porkbun.com

We are leaning into our growth and hiring for shifts that will bolster our live support coverage for US time zones. Answering phones and chats will be the primary priority of this role.

We are hiring for the following Standard Shift:  Thurs - Mon, 9 AM - 5 PM Pacific Time

 

We believe that to do your job well, you need to take paid breaks – all 8-hour shifts include a total of one hour of paid breaks.

Starting pay: $40,000 / year + benefits

This position offers full medical, dental, and vision benefits (single), starting after 90 days, and a Simple IRA plan with a matching 3% company contribution after the first year.

Close is building the modern sales-focused CRM for small, scaling businesses - just like us.

Today, we’re 100+ people across 22 countries. We’re united in our goal to help small businesses sell better by eliminating manual work and empowering them to focus on what matters most: relationships.

Close sets our compass by our customers and our people. Sustainability is core to serving both; we care deeply about the health of our business and the wellbeing of our team. We’re bootstrapped - meaning we’ve accepted no outside funding - and fully remote since 2016. The way we’ve chosen to build the business allows us to chart our own course.

Our team prioritizes impact, ownership, and quality. As a growing, remote-first company, we favor asynchronicity over meetings and we relentlessly prioritize work that moves the needle. We practice a mature approach to the workplace -- we expect our team to manage time effectively, communicate thoughtfully with teammates and customers, and produce great work.

Close's designers care about creating elegant experiences that our customers fall in love with over and over again. From beautiful interfaces to thoughtful interactions, our Product Design team brings purpose, simplicity, and impact to every touchpoint with our product.

About the Role

You'll be the dedicated designer for our Automations & Integrations team, working to transform how sales teams interact with complex, multi-step processes by making them simple and accessible through natural language.

Beyond traditional automations, you'll be leading our AI Agents strategy—designing the infrastructure and experiences that will power autonomous AI SDRs, intelligent workflow orchestration, and the next generation of agentic AI capabilities. You'll be defining an entirely new product area that positions Close at the forefront of the agentic AI revolution, leapfrogging commoditized AI SDR solutions to create genuinely innovative autonomous experiences that ultimately make an impact on the lives of our customers.

You’ll be the 5th full-time Product Designer and report to our Head of Product Design. Our design team moves fast and prioritizes high-quality design delivery. This is a hands-on IC role perfect for a Lead Designer who wants to focus on craft and impact rather than people management.

Shape the future of AI integration by defining how automations and agents can be triggered across multiple product areas (chat, assistant, voice commands)

We work in creative direction, brand strategy, and apparel design, partnering with talent like Ludwig Ahgren, Disguised Toast, and brands backed by A16Z, Red Bull, and Riot Games. We specialize in launching standalone fashion brands that make genuine cultural impact. That same authenticity is applied inward, too.

We are creative collective, innovating on everything from fashion, brands and IRL communities to editorial collaborations and fragrance projects. We’re renown for partnering with talent to launch standalone brands.

Our client roster includes A16Z, Red Bull, Riot Games, Ludwig Ahgren, Disguised Toast, and Polygon. We specialize in building authentic brand identities that resonate with Gen Z and millennial audiences through innovative apparel and lifestyle products.

Responsibilities will include:

Leading the creative process from brand discovery and concept development through tech pack creation and sample approval, working closely with talent to understand their vision, audience, and brand positioning goals
Developing comprehensive brand concepts including visual identity, apparel collections, product strategy, and go-to-market campaigns
Creating mood boards, design concepts, garment specifications, graphic treatments, and campaign creative while maintaining brand consistency across all touchpoints

Contributing to project success by managing creative workstreams, collaborating with designers, manufacturers, and marketing teams to meet launch milestones
Presenting creative concepts to talent clients and iterating based on feedback while maintaining creative integrity and brand vision

The person we're looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with. They're flexible on anything except standards that would compromise their outstanding creative work. They work ""smart"" by carefully managing their creative process and coordinating dependencies across design, production, and marketing — they prefer deep creative work but are comfortable surfacing for strategic brand conversations with talent and stakeholders.

We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or fashion tend to have a well-rounded sense of design & quality — so a variety of creative hobbies or side projects is a big plus!

Must Have Competencies:

6+ years experience in creative direction for fashion, lifestyle, or entertainment brands, with a proven track record of launching successful apparel collections and brand campaigns
Expert knowledge of fashion design process from concept to production, including technical design, fit, and manufacturing requirements

Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.

→ It’s also a great way to see what it’s like to work with us and help support folks who may not have the ‘right title’ but have the experience and technical know-how for the role.

How we work:

We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing & full time, and for that reason Superculture works differently to most shops:

Strong Values: We're selective about our partnerships and turn down projects that don't align with our values around authenticity, sustainability, and positive cultural impact
Async & Decentralized: We use tools optimized for thoughtful creative collaboration and protect deep work time for our best creative thinking
Remote Friendly: Our collective is built for remote collaboration, making our workplace more accessible and democratized
Innovation & Ownership: In addition to client work, we invest studio time in developing our own brands and products, creating additional revenue streams and creative fulfillment for our team

Entry-Level Designer @ Fun Ecom Co | Great People & Flexible Hours,JLS Trading Co.,"Charlotte, NC",Posted 17 days ago,"Nov 10th, 2025",Full-Time,Design,Anywhere in the World,$100,"Top 100, Full-Time, Anywhere in the World","Since 2012, JLS Trading Company has been in the business of taking great products and selling them with passion. We operate private label brands in nearly every consumer category from toys to tools to office products to gourmet food.
We are an 8-figure company and are growing just about 50-100% per year with no end in sight. We add dozens of new products every month and are aiming to be a 9-figure company in the not too distant future.","- Are a freak who can’t stand when things aren’t perfect?

- Do you accept Wingdings as the objectively best font?

- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?

 

If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.

 

We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.

 

--Is this a real job ad?--

Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.

 

Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):

 

http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/

 

And check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.

 

--What do you guys do?--

We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling): 

 

- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)

- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)

- Child Chucker (https://amz.run/9EUz)

 

Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC)

 

And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.

 

We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.

 

--What is your company like?--

1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.

 

2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.

 

3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.

 

4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.

 

5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.

 

6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.

 

7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]

 

8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.

 

9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.

 

10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.

 

11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.

 

12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!

 

13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.

 

--What are your company’s values?--

See here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/

 

Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.

 

--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--

No.

 

--Wait... What?--

OK fine. Super short version:

 

Learning how to be a great designer from the ground up. We’re gonna teach you everything you need to know, and don’t care at all what your previous background is.

 

Here is a bulleted list of responsibilities:

 

- Go through our apprenticeship training program

- Discover how we think about design from First Principles

- Learn the tools of the trade

- Practice, get feedback, iterate and repeat endlessly until you are an amazing designer (it takes LOTS of reps to get good at this stuff)

 

--Do I need experience?--

We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).

 

Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.

 

Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.

 

Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.

 

I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for an entry-level position... sickening. I’m literally shaking right now.

 

Also, no you don't need any experience.

 

We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.

 

The Big Bang requirement still stands though.

 

--Do I need a college degree?--

You just need to be awesome.

 

--Are there any geographic restrictions?--

As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…

 

--What is this apprentice program you speak of?--

More info here: Apprenticeship Program. This program is specifically for designers, but the general apprentice program is quite relevant and basically the same (though with different content).

 

--I’ve never designed before--

Great! If you are smart and motivated and capable of self-learning, then we can likely teach you whatever you need to know. We don’t care if you have never designed before - we care about your potential.

 

--I’ve been a designer for a long time--

Great! Though we have to warn you that we will likely want to still build your knowledge from First Principles. We will teach you things that aren’t necessarily taught in design school (much to our chagrin), and we have certain ways of doing things that aren’t necessarily standard in the industry. We think they’re good, but they take some getting used to.

 

--What type of things will I be designing?--

Graphic design for sure, but also potentially:  marketing material, packaging, products (industrial design), web stuff, and whatever else needs designing.

 

We believe that design is a master skill with principles that transcend mediums, so we’ll teach you that base, and you can likely choose to specialize as you learn more of what you do and don’t like.

 

--What are some more specific things that need designing?--

Amazing listing images, social media ads, Standard Operating Procedures, random product inserts, some way for the CEO to stop being a crazy person, product packaging, silly postcards to people, products, etc.

 

--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--

You sound just like the tax authorities!

 

--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--

Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.

 

There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.

 

Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).

 

Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!",https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jls-trading-co-entry-level-designer-fun-ecom-co-great-people-flexible-hours,See Job Description,https://weworkremotely.com/company/jls-trading-co,https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0074/7704/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&w=50&h=50&dpr=2&fit=fill&auto=compress,42

At LooseGrip, we believe marketing should make an impact — on brands, on people, and on the bottom line. Since 2009, we’ve helped companies turn data into stories and ideas into measurable growth.

We’re looking for a Paid Media Specialist who loves digging into numbers but can also connect the dots to the bigger picture. If you’re equal parts strategist, tinkerer, and storyteller — this role was built for you.

What You'll Do
Own the platforms. Plan, launch, and optimize campaigns across LinkedIn, Google, Meta, and beyond.
Chase performance. Monitor results and make data-driven optimizations that push ROI further every week.
Tell the story. Translate dashboards into clear, compelling reports and presentations for our team and clients.
Shape the funnel. Support in designing smart marketing funnels and paid media strategies that actually convert.
Be the expert in the room. Join client calls to share insight and recommendations (without needing to be the account manager).
Bring ideas to life. Help craft strategy decks and campaign visuals in Google Slides that look as sharp as they perform.
Stay curious. Keep an eye on emerging tools, platforms, and trends—and bring fresh ideas back to the team.
What We’re Looking For
Proven experience running paid media campaigns (LinkedIn Ads, Google Ads, Meta, etc.).
A sharp analytical mind—comfortable working with KPIs, metrics, and dashboards.
Strong communication skills in English; able to break down results so clients don’t just get the what but also the why.
Confident creating polished presentations to showcase strategies and performance.
Highly detail-oriented and organized, able to juggle multiple accounts and priorities.
Bonus points: Experience in funnel strategy design.
Who You Are
A strategic doer—you can zoom out to see the big picture and zoom in to optimize the details.
A relentless learner—you test, tweak, and experiment until performance improves.
A translator—you make complex ideas simple and actionable for clients.
A team player—you thrive in collaboration and believe the best work comes from working together.

Type: Flexible part-time to full-time (20–40 hours/week, depending on candidate fit)

You'll have the autonomy to define our growth strategy, select and implement the right tools and tactics, and build a modern marketing engine that drives qualified leads.

This role is perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage environments, loves experimenting with new tactics and AI-powered tools, and wants to make a significant impact on a company's trajectory.

This role is full time and fully remote, with a compensation range of $60,000 - $80,000 USD annually; based on experience.

Events: Plan and execute an ROI positive event strategy including conferences, happy hours, dinners, and webinars to build pipeline and strengthen relationships with target accounts.

Marketing to sales and CEO handoff: Define and optimize the handoff process to ensure we're delivering qualified leads that convert to opportunities.

Experience needed

B2B SaaS startup experience: You've worked at an early or growth-stage B2B startup (Seed to Series C preferred), ideally with a top-down sales model
