    "Job Description": "Who We Are…\n\nAt Nutrient, we equip developers and innovators with cutting-edge tools to simplify workflows and accelerate impactful software creation. We’re on a mission to redefine how documents are created, shared, and experienced. Our software development kits enable companies to work smarter and faster, saving time and expenses along the way, while effectively replacing the need for paper processes.\n\nYour Role at Nutrient…\n\nThe team you will be joining is responsible for the Nutrient Web SDK. Take a look at its API docs to get an understanding of the scope involved: It is a toolbox for web engineers and application developers who need a painless way to render, edit and process documents. It either runs client-side using WebAssembly or connects to the Nutrient Document Engine.\n\nThis means that our SDK has to work for diverse use cases we constantly keep learning about from our customers. It needs to be convenient to use and easy to integrate; well architected, tested and documented; and loved by LLMs.\n\nYour day to day work ranges (depending on your personal preferences and the current priorities) from writing code and documentation to talking directly with customers in order to understand their use cases and devise solutions for them, which you will incorporate into the evolving architecture of the product.\n\nIf you think you have the aptitude to contribute to building this product we would like to hear from you. You'll have autonomy, learn a lot and will shape the future of this product.\n\nWhat You’ll Bring…\n\nStrong General Programming Skills: You're well versed in OOP & FP, data structures & algorithms and understand that even a client-side SDK forms part of a larger distributed system. You’re driven by a curiosity to understand how things work.\nPassion for Building in the B2D Space:  You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by getting the user/developer experience right\nCollaborative and Self-Managing: You don't need hand-holding, and you're gaining energy from exchanging ideas, both async and sync.\nBias towards Shipping: You move fast and take ownership for solving problems from start to finish.\n\nWhat We'll Bring…\n\nWe are a globally distributed company, backed by Insight Partners. We embrace a low-meeting culture and prioritize asynchronous communication to provide flexibility and focus. Working hours overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe, and Asia.\n\nWe offer competitive salaries, comprehensive benefits, and an annual global retreat to celebrate achievements and foster connections. Past retreats have taken place in locations like Croatia, Spain, and Greece. \n\nNutrient believes in equal opportunity, we employ people from many different cultures and countries. We celebrate diversity and are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, skill sets, perspectives, as well as providing our employees with a work environment free of harassment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, marital status, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other non-merit factor. \n\nWe are a remote company. To ensure overlap with most of the team across the US, Europe and Asia, we’re looking for someone who will have a significant overlap with US and European working hours.  If working from the US, you must be located in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, or Virginia for payroll processing.",

It’s also important to us that we have a positive impact on the world.\n\nIf you want to know more about how we work, our founder, Joel, gave a talk about it (9 years ago, but we still work this way!).\n\n \n\nWhat you'll work on\n\nYou’ll spend your time supporting Cliniko customers. This includes:\n\nResponding to chat/email messages from existing customers.\nHelping people decide if Cliniko would suit their business.\nCommunicating with people via social media.\nWorking with our developers to resolve issues.\nWorking with third party integrators to solve customer problems.\n\nOur goal is to do right by our customers in every single interaction, so you'll be empowered (and expected) to provide amazing support.\n\n \n\nRequirements\n\nWe are looking for someone to help with coverage during NZ and Australian business hours (Mon-Fri, within 5am-7pm AEDT). There is also the option to work some hours over the weekend instead of during the week. \n\nWe won't consider applications from anyone intending to work outside of these hours, and your work day must entirely fall within 6am to 7pm in your local time zone. We understand that some people consider themselves \"night owls”, but this won't be a reason to consider you for this role if you are in a conflicting time zone. Instead, please keep an eye out for when we’re hiring in a more suitable time for you. We care greatly about the health of our team and their ability to work with us long term. We want to make sure the job is a positive in their lives, and we believe working during daylight hours is important for that.\n\n \n\nAbout you\n\nYou want to work in a place where you can do your best work and have fun too. You want to constantly improve. You have empathy and can place yourself in the shoes of the people using Cliniko. \n\nYou have superb English skills (both verbal and written). You are able to communicate your thoughts in a friendly, accurate, and jargon-free way. You appreciate a good Oxford comma.\n\nNo matter what your background is, or how you identify, if you feel you would be a great fit here, we encourage you to apply. We are committed to the continual diversification of the team and working to constantly improve our inclusivity, which is crucial to how we work.\n\n \n\nHow we work\n\nHere are some things that we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:\n\n30-hour work week, full-time pay.\nFlexible hours.\nWork from anywhere.\nUnlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).\nSupplied computer equipment.\nErgonomic furniture.\nFresh organic fruit delivered weekly to your home.\nOverseas trips for team meet-ups.\nNo managers.\nNo scheduled meetings.\n\nThe salary for this position will be $90,000 AUD, or equivalent in your local currency.\n\nThe pay is based on the work you'll do with us and the value you'll add to our team. Don't be discouraged if this is above your previous earnings. Your income history is not part of our decision making.\n\n \n\nIn summary\n\nWe're looking for someone special. We don't hire often and when we do, we usually get thousands of applicants. We will do our best to offer you a job you can love, and one that lets you achieve your best, but we also expect you to do your part.\n\nYou should be absolutely passionate about providing amazing support. You should take pride in your work and be excited to do it.\n\n \n\nHow to apply\n\nAfter hitting the red \"Apply now\" button, you'll be taken to an application page with a few question on it. The “short friendly summary” field needs to give us enough information to be interested in taking you to the next stage. We typically get a lot of applications, so please put some effort into this section. Notably, there's no resume or cover letter submission, so this is your spot to give us some insight into who you are. Be yourself, there’s no need for formality! \n\nThere will also be a few other short questions that require some searching on our website. It's important to answer all of them correctly, as we won’t consider any applications that get any of these wrong.\n\nWe recommend not using AI to help you with your application. ChatGPT’s personality just isn’t going to make the cut and get past the first round. As well as probably leading to your application being rejected, you will not be able to rely on AI in the support role that you're applying for. Although we continually test AI tools to see if they can be useful in our workflow, our support team currently doesn't use them because we have found they can lower the quality of our work.\n\nNote: While the form does allow you to upload a resume, it’s only to pre-fill the contact fields for you. We won’t actually see the resume.\n\nApplications are open until the 7th of November at 11:59 PM AEDT. \n\n \n\nWhat you can expect after applying\n\nOnce you’ve applied, sit back and relax while we get to work on our side! We’ll be reviewing all the applications as they come in and we’ll get back to you within 2 weeks after applications close. Everyone will hear back from us, successful or not.\n\nIf we select you, the next stage will be a short 5 minute chat with our founder, Joel. Following the chat, if you’re still a contender, there will be a support task to complete. These tasks are paid.\n\nLastly, you’ll meet with some people from our team and then we’ll make the final decision on who we hire. This is the exciting part for us and hopefully also for you. This will happen fast, and the start date will be chosen by the applicant.\n\nWe know it’s quite a process to go through, so we want to make sure you know what you’re in for up front. We’ll be transparent with everyone along the way.\n\nOne final note, unfortunately due to the quantity of applications we receive, we are not able to provide feedback for those not successful in the first round. In the later stages, we’ll do our best to provide what we can, if requested.\n\nGood luck!",

Our no-nonsense interface and super-affordable prices mean we’re adding new customers at a fantastic rate. We have become the go-to registrar for tech-savvy individuals such as developers. At the same time, bargain-hunters are thrilled to learn that we offer incredible support despite our industry-low prices.\n\nWe think Porkbun.com is the best registrar in the world, and if you check out our TrustPilot reviews, you’ll see that’s not just our own bias talking. But even the easiest-to-use interface can’t solve every customer problem.\n\nTypical issues:\n\n“How do I connect my domain to Shopify?”\n\n“How do I transfer my domain to Porkbun?”\n\n“My website isn’t working.”\n\n“How do I purchase WordPress hosting?”\n\n“Why didn’t my payment go through?”\n\n“How do I connect my hosted email to Outlook?”\n\n“Why is your company named Porkbun?”\n\nExperience –  professional or personal – with domains, hosting, DNS is required, or, absent that, very strong experience in live technical support.  We are looking for someone with proven technical and diagnostic ability who loves learning new things.

If you are responding NO, we are sorry, but you are not eligible for the role:\n\nAre you based in the USA and eligible for employment (Yes/No)?\n\nAre you based in one of the following states: California, Idaho, Oregon, Texas, or Washington (Yes/No)? \n\nDo you have two or more years of live technical support experience, or experience with domains, DNS, hosting? (Yes/No) If yes, which? \n\nAre you available and interested in working both Saturday and Sunday(Yes/No)?\n\nFeel free to add other relevant, brief content to your email but it must begin with those questions and your accurate responses\n\nSend that email with attachments to careers+support@porkbun.com\n\nWe are leaning into our growth and hiring for shifts that will bolster our live support coverage for US time zones.

Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.\n\n \n\nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):\n\n \n\nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n\nAnd check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.\n\n \n\n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling): \n\n \n\n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n- Child Chucker (https://amz.run/9EUz)\n\n \n\nRunning this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC)\n\n \n\nAnd we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.\n\n \n\nWe are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n\n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.\n\n \n\n2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.\n\n \n\n3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.\n\n \n\n4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n\n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n\n6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.\n\n \n\n7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]\n\n \n\n8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n\n9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\n \n\n10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n\n11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n\n12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!\n\n \n\n13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n\n--What are your company’s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n\nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n\n--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n\n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \n\nLearning how to be a great designer from the ground up. We’re gonna teach you everything you need to know, and don’t care at all what your previous background is.\n\n \n\nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n \n\n- Go through our apprenticeship training program\n\n- Discover how we think about design from First Principles\n\n- Learn the tools of the trade\n\n- Practice, get feedback, iterate and repeat endlessly until you are an amazing designer (it takes LOTS of reps to get good at this stuff)\n\n \n\n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \n\nOh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \n\nOh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \n\nOh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \n\nI might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for an entry-level position... sickening. I’m literally shaking right now.\n\n \n\nAlso, no you don't need any experience.\n\n \n\nWe want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.\n\n \n\nThe Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n\n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n\n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nAs long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…\n\n \n\n--What is this apprentice program you speak of?--\n\nMore info here: Apprenticeship Program. This program is specifically for designers, but the general apprentice program is quite relevant and basically the same (though with different content).\n\n \n\n--I’ve never designed before--\n\nGreat! If you are smart and motivated and capable of self-learning, then we can likely teach you whatever you need to know. We don’t care if you have never designed before - we care about your potential.\n\n \n\n--I’ve been a designer for a long time--\n\nGreat! Though we have to warn you that we will likely want to still build your knowledge from First Principles. We will teach you things that aren’t necessarily taught in design school (much to our chagrin), and we have certain ways of doing things that aren’t necessarily standard in the industry. We think they’re good, but they take some getting used to.\n\n \n\n--What type of things will I be designing?--\n\nGraphic design for sure, but also potentially:  marketing material, packaging, products (industrial design), web stuff, and whatever else needs designing.\n\n \n\nWe believe that design is a master skill with principles that transcend mediums, so we’ll teach you that base, and you can likely choose to specialize as you learn more of what you do and don’t like.\n\n \n\n--What are some more specific things that need designing?--\n\nAmazing listing images, social media ads, Standard Operating Procedures, random product inserts, some way for the CEO to stop being a crazy person, product packaging, silly postcards to people, products, etc.\n\n \n\n--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like the tax authorities!\n\n \n\n--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \n\nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \n\nOnce you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \n\nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!",
